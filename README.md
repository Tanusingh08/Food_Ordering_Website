We know that online food ordering sites has transformed the way we satisfy our foodie cravings. Users may easily discover a wide range of food styles, browse menus of nearby restaurants, and place orders from the comfort of their own homes with a few clicks. These platforms provide a seamless experience, allowing customers to customize their orders, track deliveries in real time, and pay securely online. So I made a similar project based on the online food ordering website with a modified UI for the Home Page, Cart Page and so on.
